                        Bhagat Singh, (born September 27, 1907, Lyallpur, western Punjab, India [now in Pakistan]—died
                        March
                        23, 1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan]), revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement.

                        Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a
                        reform
                        sect of modern Hinduism), and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest
                        British rule in India while still a youth and soon fought for national independence. He also
                        worked
                        as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing Marxist
                        theories. He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the
                        revolution”).

                        In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of
                        Indian writer and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a
                        silent march opposing the Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, junior
                        officer
                        J.P. Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. In
                        1929
                        he and an associate lobbed a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the
                        implementation of the Defence of India Act and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23
                        for
                        the murder of Saunders.

                    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose, byname Netaji (Hindi: “Respected Leader”), (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India—died August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan?), Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence movement against British rule of India. He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.</p>

                        Early life and political activity
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College, Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and the Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India. Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889–1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party) politician.
